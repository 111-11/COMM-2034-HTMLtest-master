     <h1>Course Opinion:</h1>
       <p>Ethics is informative and eye opening. Everytime I go to this class I'm entertained throughout. Dr. Mackay always has interesting examples of ethics that has my eyes wide open the whole time. The exams are diffcult but if you can push through the two exams then you will have a great time in this course. The group debate is so much fun and allows you show your public speaking skills and debate skills off in front of the class. Ethics is important and I'm glad I'm learning about this topic</p>
