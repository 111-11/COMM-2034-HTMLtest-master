     <h1>Course Opinion:</h1>
     <p>Research is orginal and interactive. I haven't really ever been in a class like this one. I never knew how in-depth research was but there are many different levels. Although this is not my favorite course and I don't love all the exams; I do love how interactive it is. A lot of the big stuff that we learn in this course is applied in the field with projects. Conducting the focus group was enjoyable. Lastly, this course is orginal in its material. I don't think I have ever had a course with this type of material and I think that interesting. </p>
