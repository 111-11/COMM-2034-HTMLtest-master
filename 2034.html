     <h1>Course Opinion:</h1>
     <p>Visual Media is creative and fun. I enjoy this course becasue it allows me to use my creative side that I dont always get to use in other classes. I like how most of the projects are in groups so you are able to work with others and devlop your skills with other people. I also like how there aren't any exams. I'm not the best test taker so being able to learn the material in a different way is cool. It is sometimes diffuclt trying to learn the neccesary skills in order to complete some of the projects but when you are finshed you feel proud and fulfilled.</p>
