     <h1>Course Description:</h1>
       <p>This course is broken down into three exams and three quizzes. The exams are weighted as 20% each so 60% total. The quizzes are weighted as 12% each so 36% total. Reading out of the textbook is most of the out of class work. The textbook for this particular course is James  A.  Herrick,
 The  History  and  Theory  of  Rhetoric:  An  Introduction, 6th ed. The grading scale is A-F normal scale. The actual material looks at the history of rhetoric, the philosphers who built rheotric, those who opposed the study and how to perfect the study.</p>

     <h1>Course Opinion:</h1>
       <p>I personally enjoy this class because there isn't that much busy work to do. You go to class and Dr.Howell gives you a presentation on the material then you go home and study. Dr. Howell gives you a study guide around test time and you are pretty much already prepared. I think it's simple and you still learn the material. The quzzies are a little tough beacuse they are done in class over a powerpoint so that is most likely my least favorite part of the course. The material is interesting and informative. It shines a light on how we as a society communicate in many different aspects including law, poltics, in sport and socially. I enjoy Rhetoric.</p>
